# C-Toolbox-for-Beginners
A dense reference for beginning C students
Understanding C is for me a step in understanding the essential underpinnings of Python. Learning new languages, computer or spoken, is an extraordinary way to exercise the brain but having multiple reference perspectives can frequently make the task easier and more fun.  Hopefully this toolbox will get the notice of someone whom it can help.  This document can be accessed online at www.wikipython.com where you will find no registration, fees, charges, cookies, ads, or ulterior agendas, no contributions accepted, and nobody looking for a job.  Any corrections, errors, changes, suggestions, etc., gratefully appreciated. Email me at oakey.john@yahoo.com
